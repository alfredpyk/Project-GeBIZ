Extraction of Opportunities and creation of a knowledgebase from GeBIZ

## Background
GeBIZ is the Singapore Government's one-stop e-procurement portal. All the public sector's invitations for quotations and tenders are posted on GeBIZ. Suppliers can search for government procurement opportunities, download tender documents, and submit their bids online.
## Problem and Motivation
For a project manager/ professional, searching for GeBIZ opportunities tends to be a rather manual process. Even worse, the process of consolidating and tracking the opportunities can be tedious and time-consuming. Precious time is wasted on performing such administrative work instead of preparing for a winning bid.
In addition, much info could be gather for and as company's knowledge base and communication purposes.
## Objective (HWC - How We Could)
With RPA, the bot could automatically login (an option) to GeBIZ every day and extract the opportunities based on the defined keywords. Details of the extracted opportunities will be updated into an Excel spreadsheet for easy viewing and tracking. The bot can also download all the quotation documents into Knowledge Management system like SharePoint or LiveLink for further collaboration. Furthermore, it can further create a calendar invite in Outlook to keep track of the tender closing date.
As this is our first mini-project and time constraint, team Madagascar would do the minimum:
- Provide necessary search options;
- Extract Reference index within the scope of search;
- Extract necessary info and details
## Selected Dataset
As this is a mini-project, Madagascar is to focus only on data provided within GeBIZ.gov.sg site.
## Approach
Use of UiPath-Studio:
- on simple dialogue;
- In-built Data Scraping Tool
## Documents
Various documents come with project:
- This README.md
- Project Progression Reports (weekly)
- PDD (Process Definition Document)
- SDD (Solution Definition Document)
(These document could be found in both the assets directory and designated Google-Shared drive)
## Remarks
On such project/job, on average last about 5 days and costing between S$1,500 - 2,000.
As mention above vaguely, the scope of such project could be expanded to encompass areas in analytics and dashboardings.
