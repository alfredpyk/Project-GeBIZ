### Industry Challenge: Automating tracking of business opportunities

Projects are the lifeblood of many enterprises and they are often issued as tenders by large multinational corporations (MNCs) and/or government. Time and effort are usually spent monitoring or scanning through tender platforms such as GeBIZ. Furthermore, the specifications of the tenders are often hidden in attached documents prepared by client organisations, and going through this process can be tedious and time-consuming.
